# OKFish
Basic fish/bird AI system for Unity3D. I made this for Six & Six, the 6th game on the [HauntedPS1 Madvent Calendar](https://hauntedps1.itch.io/madvent2020). The goal wass to simulate a large (and distant) crowd in a computationally cheap manner, which I reckon I've done successfully.

This is old code that I've now open-sourced, it's provided as-is and not supported. Would appreciate being credited if you use it for a purpose.

The system consists of two entirely portable scripts with no dependencies:
- FishSpawn.cs spawns your fish
- FishAI.cs moves them.
